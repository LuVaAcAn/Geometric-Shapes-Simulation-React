# 🎨 Simulation of Geometric Shapes in React

Welcome to my interactive simulation project, developed in React. In this project, geometric shapes (squares, circles, triangles) fall due to gravity and respond to user interaction, allowing you to apply force to lift them.

## 🚀 Características

- **Gravity:** Geometric shapes fall from the top of the screen and stop when they hit the ground. 🌍
- **Dynamic Interaction:** By clicking and holding the mouse button, you can apply a force to lift the shapes. 🌟
- **Real-Time Force:** The applied force is calculated in real-time and capped at a maximum value. ⚙️
- **Diseño Atractivo:** A force bar displays the intensity of the applied force. 🎨

## 🎯 Requirements
- **Node.js**: [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **NPM/Yarn**: Included with Node.js

## 📦 Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tu-usuario/tu-repositorio.git` 

2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    `cd tu-repositorio` 
    
3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    `npm install` 
    
## 🚀 Running the App
To run the application in development mode:
`npm start` 
This will open your browser with the app at `http://localhost:3000`.
